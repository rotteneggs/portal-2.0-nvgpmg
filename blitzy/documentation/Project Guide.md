This centralized hub transforms how educational institutions manage prospective and enrolled students by digitizing and automating critical admissions processes.

The platform is built using a modern technology stack consisting of:
- **Backend**: Laravel 10.x (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: React 18.x with TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+
- **Caching**: Redis 7.0+
- **Document Storage**: Amazon S3

## Coding Standards

### PHP/Laravel
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use type hints and return types
- Document classes and methods with PHPDoc
- Use Laravel conventions for naming:
  - Controllers: Singular, PascalCase, suffixed with "Controller" (e.g., `UserController`)
  - Models: Singular, PascalCase (e.g., `User`)
  - Migrations: Snake case with timestamp prefix (e.g., `2023_01_01_create_users_table`)
  - Tables: Plural, snake_case (e.g., `users`)

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Use functional components with hooks for React
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)
  - Hooks: camelCase prefixed with "use" (e.g., `useAuth`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

## Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-document-verification
   ```

2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add document verification service with OCR capabilities"
   ```

3. Keep your branch up to date with main:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. Push your branch and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/add-document-verification
   ```

5. Ensure all tests pass in CI before merging

## Documentation

- Document all APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Update relevant documentation when adding or changing features
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Write meaningful commit messages and PR descriptions

## Performance Considerations

- Use eager loading to prevent N+1 query issues
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement lazy loading for React components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

## Security Best Practices

- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid vulnerabilities
- Implement CSRF protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Backend Issues
- Check Laravel logs at `src/backend/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Verify database connection settings
- Ensure Redis server is running
- Check for permission issues in storage directories

### Common Frontend Issues
- Clear browser cache and local storage
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoint configuration
- Ensure node modules are up to date

## Deployment Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Create a pull request to the appropriate environment branch
3. Wait for CI/CD pipeline to complete
4. Review deployment in staging environment
5. Approve production deployment when ready

For detailed deployment instructions, see [Deployment Guide](docs/development/deployment.md).
