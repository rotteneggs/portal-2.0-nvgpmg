"I am designing a new **student admissions enrollment platform** that will serve as a centralized hub for prospective and enrolled students to manage their application, track progress, engage with support services, and complete administrative tasks. The platform should be built using **Laravel (backend), MySQL (database), React (frontend), and Redis (for caching and session management)** to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

### **Key Functionalities:**

- **Application Management**: Online application submission, document uploads, and tracking

- **Automated Admissions Workflow**: Status updates, decision notifications, and document verification

- **Personalized Student Dashboard**: Displays application progress, checklist, deadlines, and communication history

- **Integration with SIS and LMS**: Sync student records, course registration, and onboarding tasks

- **Communication Tools**: In-app messaging, email notifications, and support ticketing system

- **AI-Driven Guidance**: Personalized recommendations for completing the admissions process smoothly

- **Financial Aid & Payment Processing**: Tuition estimates, scholarship applications, and fee payments

- **Redis Caching**: Optimize performance for real-time data updates and session handling

- **WYSIWYG Editor:** allow administrators to edit, create, and modify workflow

### **Request for AI Recommendations:**

Given these requirements, what would be the ideal **system architecture, database schema, and AI-driven features** to enhance user experience and automate key enrollment processes? Additionally, how can we leverage **AI for predictive analytics, document verification, and chatbot-assisted student support**?
