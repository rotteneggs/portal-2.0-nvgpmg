# API Overview

## Introduction
The Student Admissions Enrollment Platform API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing the entire student admissions lifecycle, from application submission to enrollment confirmation. This documentation serves as a guide for developers integrating with the platform.

### API Design Principles
The API follows RESTful design principles with resource-oriented endpoints, consistent naming conventions, and appropriate HTTP methods. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Versioned API**: All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/` to support future versioning
- **Resource-Based Structure**: Endpoints are organized around core resources (applications, documents, users)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication using Laravel Sanctum
- **Response Formats**: Consistent JSON structure with standardized error handling

### Base URL
All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.admissions.institution.edu/api/v1
```

For development and testing environments, use:

```
https://staging-api.admissions.institution.edu/api/v1
https://dev-api.admissions.institution.edu/api/v1
```

## Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with Laravel Sanctum. All API endpoints (except for public endpoints) require a valid authentication token to be included in the request header.

### Authentication Flow
1. Register a user account or log in with existing credentials
2. Receive an access token and optional refresh token
3. Include the access token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests
4. Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token when needed

For detailed information on authentication endpoints and flows, see the [Authentication documentation](authentication.md).

### Token Usage
Include the access token in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Access tokens have a limited lifetime (typically 15-60 minutes) for security reasons. Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring re-authentication.

### Multi-Factor Authentication
The API supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. When MFA is enabled, the login process requires an additional verification step. See the [Authentication documentation](authentication.md) for details on MFA implementation.

## API Conventions
The API follows consistent conventions for requests, responses, and error handling.

### Request Format
- **Content-Type**: All requests should include `Content-Type: application/json` header (except for file uploads, which use `multipart/form-data`)
- **Accept**: Include `Accept: application/json` header to receive JSON responses
- **HTTP Methods**: Use appropriate HTTP methods for different operations:
  - `GET`: Retrieve resources
  - `POST`: Create resources
  - `PUT`: Update resources
  - `DELETE`: Remove resources

### Response Format
All API responses are returned in JSON format with a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Resource data or collection
  },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 100,
      "per_page": 15,
      "current_page": 1,
      "last_page": 7,
      "from": 1,
      "to": 15
    }
  },
  "message": "Optional success message"
}
```

Paginated responses include a `meta.pagination` object with pagination details.

### Error Handling
Error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {
      // Optional detailed error information
      "field_name": ["Validation error message"]
    }
  }
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200 OK`: Request succeeded
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request format or parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required or failed
- `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated but insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Validation errors
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

### Pagination
List endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page`: Number of items per page (default: 15, max: 50)

Paginated responses include a `meta.pagination` object with pagination details.

### Filtering and Sorting
Many list endpoints support filtering and sorting with query parameters:

- Filtering: Use field-specific parameters (e.g., `status=active`)
- Sorting: Use `sort` parameter with field name, prefix with `-` for descending order (e.g., `sort=created_at` or `sort=-created_at`)

## Core Resources
The API is organized around the following core resources:

### Users and Authentication
Endpoints for user registration, authentication, and profile management. See the [Authentication documentation](authentication.md) for details.

### Applications
Endpoints for creating, updating, submitting, and tracking applications throughout the admissions process. See the [Applications documentation](applications.md) for details.

### Documents
Endpoints for uploading, retrieving, verifying, and managing documents as part of the application process. See the [Documents documentation](documents.md) for details.

### Workflows
Endpoints for interacting with the admissions workflow system, including workflow definitions, stages, and transitions. See the [Workflows documentation](workflows.md) for details.

### Messages
Endpoints for communication between applicants and admissions staff. See the [Messages documentation](messaging.md) for details.

### Notifications
Endpoints for managing notifications and notification preferences. See the [Notifications documentation](notifications.md) for details.

### Payments
Endpoints for processing application fees and other payments. See the [Payments documentation](payments.md) for details.

### Financial Aid
Endpoints for financial aid applications and document management. See the [Financial Aid documentation](financial-aid.md) for details.

## Integration Patterns
This section provides guidance on common integration patterns for the API.

### Student Information System (SIS) Integration
The API supports bidirectional integration with Student Information Systems:

- **Data Synchronization**: Endpoints for synchronizing student data between systems
- **Enrollment Processing**: Endpoints for transferring admitted students to the SIS
- **Academic Program Data**: Endpoints for retrieving program information from the SIS

Implement webhook listeners to receive real-time updates when application statuses change or when students are admitted.

### Learning Management System (LMS) Integration
The API supports integration with Learning Management Systems:

- **User Provisioning**: Endpoints for creating user accounts in the LMS
- **Course Enrollment**: Endpoints for enrolling admitted students in orientation courses
- **Single Sign-On**: Support for SSO between the admissions platform and LMS

Use the API to automate the transition from admitted student to enrolled student in the LMS.

### Payment Gateway Integration
The API supports integration with payment gateways for processing application fees and deposits:

- **Payment Processing**: Endpoints for initiating and tracking payments
- **Receipt Generation**: Endpoints for generating payment receipts
- **Refund Processing**: Endpoints for processing refunds when necessary

Implement webhook listeners to receive real-time payment status updates.

### Document Verification Services
The API supports integration with external document verification services:

- **Verification Requests**: Endpoints for submitting documents for verification
- **Verification Results**: Endpoints for receiving verification results

Implement webhook listeners to receive verification status updates.

## Security Considerations
This section provides guidance on security best practices when integrating with the API.

### Token Security
- Store access tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for web applications)
- Never store tokens in client-side storage accessible by JavaScript
- Implement token refresh logic to maintain user sessions
- Revoke tokens when they are no longer needed

### Data Protection
- Always use HTTPS for API requests
- Minimize the amount of sensitive data transmitted
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting API access

### Rate Limiting
The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limits vary by endpoint and user role. When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit window resets

Implement appropriate backoff strategies when rate limit errors are encountered.

### Webhook Security
When configuring webhooks:
- Use HTTPS endpoints for receiving webhook events
- Validate webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- Implement idempotent processing to handle duplicate events
- Respond quickly to webhook requests (within 5 seconds)

## Versioning and Deprecation
The API uses versioning to ensure backward compatibility while allowing for future enhancements.

### API Versioning
The current API version is v1, indicated in the URL path (`/api/v1/`). When breaking changes are introduced, a new version will be released (e.g., `/api/v2/`).

The API also supports version specification via the Accept header:
```
Accept: application/vnd.admissions.v1+json
```

### Deprecation Policy
When features are deprecated:
- A deprecation notice will be provided in the documentation
- The `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers will be included in responses
- A minimum 12-month overlap period will be provided where both old and new versions are supported

Monitor the API changelog and announcements for deprecation notices.

## API Client Libraries
Official client libraries are available for common programming languages to simplify API integration.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```bash
npm install @institution/admissions-api-client
```

Basic usage:
```javascript
import { AdmissionsClient } from '@institution/admissions-api-client';

const client = new AdmissionsClient('https://api.admissions.institution.edu');

// Authenticate
await client.authenticate(email, password);

// Get applications
const applications = await client.applications.list();
```

### PHP
```bash
composer require institution/admissions-api-client
```

Basic usage:
```php
$client = new \Institution\AdmissionsClient('https://api.admissions.institution.edu');

// Authenticate
$client->authenticate($email, $password);

// Get applications
$applications = $client->applications->list();
```

### Python
```bash
pip install institution-admissions-client
```

Basic usage:
```python
from institution import AdmissionsClient

client = AdmissionsClient('https://api.admissions.institution.edu')

# Authenticate
client.authenticate(email, password)

# Get applications
applications = client.applications.list()
```

### Custom Integration
For custom integrations, use the [OpenAPI specification](openapi.yaml) to generate client code for your preferred language or framework.

## Webhooks
The API supports webhooks for real-time event notifications. Webhooks allow your application to receive push notifications when specific events occur, rather than polling the API for updates.

### Available Events
Common webhook events include:
- `application.created`: A new application has been created
- `application.updated`: An application has been updated
- `application.submitted`: An application has been submitted
- `application.status_changed`: An application's status has changed
- `document.uploaded`: A new document has been uploaded
- `document.verified`: A document has been verified
- `payment.completed`: A payment has been completed

See the documentation for each resource for a complete list of available events.

### Webhook Payload
Webhook payloads follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "event": "application.submitted",
  "timestamp": "2023-04-15T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

The `data` object contains information relevant to the specific event.

### Webhook Configuration
Webhooks can be configured in the administrative interface or via the API. When configuring a webhook, you can specify:
- The endpoint URL to receive events
- The events you want to subscribe to
- A secret key for signature verification

Your endpoint should respond with a 2xx status code within 5 seconds to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

## Best Practices
This section provides recommendations for effectively using the API.

### Performance Optimization
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Request only the data you need using field filtering
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates
- Batch operations when possible

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all API requests
- Check the `success` field in responses to determine if the request succeeded
- Handle rate limiting with appropriate backoff strategies
- Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
- Provide user-friendly error messages in your application

### Testing
- Use the staging environment for testing before deploying to production
- Create test accounts for different user roles
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement automated tests for critical API integrations
- Monitor API usage and performance in production
