## Introduction

This document describes the workflow architecture of the Student Admissions Enrollment Platform, which is a core component that enables the flexible definition and execution of admissions processes. The workflow system consists of two main parts: the WYSIWYG workflow editor for administrators to visually design workflows, and the workflow engine that executes these workflows to process student applications through the admissions lifecycle.

## Workflow System Overview

The workflow system is designed to provide a flexible, configurable approach to managing the admissions process. It allows educational institutions to define custom workflows for different application types (undergraduate, graduate, transfer, etc.) with unique stages, requirements, and decision paths.

### Key Features

- Visual workflow editor with drag-and-drop interface
- Support for multiple workflow templates by application type
- Conditional transitions between stages based on application data
- Automatic and manual transitions
- Role-based permissions for workflow actions
- Stage-specific document requirements and actions
- Notification triggers at various workflow points
- Workflow validation to ensure proper configuration

### System Components

The workflow system consists of the following key components:

1. **Workflow Models**: Database entities that define workflows, stages, and transitions
2. **Workflow Service**: Backend service for managing workflow definitions
3. **Workflow Engine Service**: Backend service for executing workflow processes
4. **WYSIWYG Editor**: Frontend components for visual workflow design
5. **Application Status Tracking**: Components for displaying workflow progress to users'

## Data Model

The workflow system is built on a flexible data model that supports complex workflow definitions with stages, transitions, and conditions.

### Core Entities

- **Workflow**: Defines a complete admissions process for a specific application type
- **WorkflowStage**: Represents a distinct phase in the admissions process with specific requirements
- **WorkflowTransition**: Defines the paths between stages, including conditions and permissions
- **ApplicationStatus**: Tracks the current and historical status of an application within a workflow

## Backend Implementation

The backend implementation of the workflow system consists of services that manage workflow definitions and execute workflow processes.

### WorkflowService

The `WorkflowService` is responsible for managing workflow definitions, including:

- Creating, updating, and deleting workflows
- Managing workflow stages and their properties
- Managing transitions between stages
- Activating and deactivating workflows
- Validating workflow configurations
- Duplicating workflows for template creation

Key methods include:

```php
// Workflow management
getWorkflows(array $filters, int $perPage): Paginator
getWorkflowById(int $id): ?Workflow
getActiveWorkflowForType(string $applicationType): ?Workflow
createWorkflow(array $data, User $user): Workflow
updateWorkflow(Workflow $workflow, array $data, User $user): Workflow
deleteWorkflow(Workflow $workflow, User $user): bool
activateWorkflow(Workflow $workflow, User $user): Workflow
deactivateWorkflow(Workflow $workflow, User $user): Workflow
duplicateWorkflow(Workflow $workflow, string $newName, User $user): Workflow
validateWorkflow(Workflow $workflow): array

// Stage management
getWorkflowStages(Workflow $workflow): Collection
createWorkflowStage(Workflow $workflow, array $data, User $user): WorkflowStage
updateWorkflowStage(WorkflowStage $stage, array $data, User $user): WorkflowStage
deleteWorkflowStage(WorkflowStage $stage, User $user): bool
reorderWorkflowStages(Workflow $workflow, array $stageOrder, User $user): bool

// Transition management
getWorkflowTransitions(Workflow $workflow, array $filters): Collection
createWorkflowTransition(WorkflowStage $sourceStage, WorkflowStage $targetStage, array $data, User $user): WorkflowTransition
updateWorkflowTransition(WorkflowTransition $transition, array $data, User $user): WorkflowTransition
deleteWorkflowTransition(WorkflowTransition $transition, User $user): bool
```

### WorkflowEngineService

The `WorkflowEngineService` is responsible for executing workflow processes, including:

- Initializing workflows for new applications
- Processing stage completions
- Executing transitions between stages
- Evaluating transition conditions
- Checking for automatic transitions
- Sending notifications based on workflow events

Key methods include:

```php
// Workflow execution
initializeApplicationWorkflow(Application $application, User $user): bool
processStageCompletion(Application $application, WorkflowStage $stage, User $user, array $completionData): bool
executeTransition(Application $application, WorkflowTransition $transition, User $user, array $transitionData): bool
checkAutomaticTransitions(Application $application): bool

// Status and stage management
getCurrentStage(Application $application): ?WorkflowStage
getApplicationStatusHistory(Application $application): Collection
evaluateStageRequirements(Application $application, WorkflowStage $stage): array
getNextStages(Application $application, User $user): Collection
getAvailableTransitions(Application $application, User $user): Collection

// Notification and logging
sendStageNotifications(Application $application, WorkflowStage $stage, string $event): bool
logWorkflowAction(string $action, Application $application, ?WorkflowStage $stage, User $user, array $additionalData): void
```

### Event Handling

The workflow system uses Laravel's event system to trigger actions when workflow events occur:

- **ApplicationStatusChangedEvent**: Triggered when an application moves to a new status
- **WorkflowStageCompletedEvent**: Triggered when a workflow stage is completed
- **DocumentVerifiedEvent**: Can trigger automatic transitions when documents are verified

These events are handled by listeners that perform actions such as:

- Sending notifications to applicants and staff
- Updating related records
- Triggering integrations with external systems
- Checking for automatic transitions to the next stage

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation of the workflow system provides a visual editor for administrators and status tracking for applicants.

### WYSIWYG Workflow Editor

The workflow editor is built using React with the React Flow library for the interactive canvas. Key components include:

- **WorkflowCanvas**: The main canvas component that renders stages and transitions
- **StageNode**: Custom node component for rendering workflow stages
- **TransitionEdge**: Custom edge component for rendering transitions between stages
- **StageProperties**: Panel for editing stage properties
- **TransitionProperties**: Panel for editing transition properties
- **WorkflowToolbar**: Toolbar with actions for the workflow editor

The editor supports:

- Drag-and-drop stage positioning
- Visual creation of transitions between stages
- Editing stage and transition properties
- Validation of workflow configurations
- Saving and activating workflows
- Zooming and panning the canvas
- Minimap for navigation

### Application Status Tracking

For applicants and staff, the workflow system provides components to track application status:

- **ApplicationTimeline**: Visual representation of the application's progress through workflow stages
- **StatusCard**: Card showing current status with progress indicator
- **NextSteps**: Component showing required actions for the current stage
- **DocumentStatus**: Component showing document requirements and verification status

These components use Redux to maintain application state and React Query for data fetching.

### State Management

The workflow editor uses Redux for state management with the following key slices:

- **workflowsSlice**: Manages workflow data, stages, transitions, and editor state
- **applicationsSlice**: Manages application data including status information

Key state elements include:

- Current workflow data
- Stages and their positions
- Transitions between stages
- Selected stage or transition
- Editor mode (viewing, creating transition, etc.)
- Zoom level and pan position

Async operations like fetching and saving workflows are implemented using Redux Thunk.

## Workflow Execution Process

This section details how workflows are executed during the application process.

### Application Initialization

When an application is submitted, the workflow process is initialized:

1. The system identifies the appropriate workflow based on the application type
2. The initial stage of the workflow is determined
3. An ApplicationStatus record is created for the initial stage
4. The application's current_status_id is updated
5. Notifications are sent based on the stage's notification triggers
6. The ApplicationStatusChangedEvent is dispatched

### Stage Processing

As an application progresses through a workflow stage:

1. Required documents and actions are tracked
2. Document uploads and verifications are linked to stage requirements
3. Staff can review the application based on assigned roles
4. Stage completion can be triggered manually by staff or automatically based on conditions
5. When a stage is completed, the WorkflowStageCompletedEvent is dispatched

### Transition Execution

Transitions between stages can occur in two ways:

1. **Manual Transitions**:
   - Staff with appropriate permissions can manually move an application to the next stage
   - The system verifies that the user has the required permissions
   - The system checks that any transition conditions are met
   - If valid, the transition is executed and a new ApplicationStatus is created

2. **Automatic Transitions**:
   - The system periodically checks for applications that meet automatic transition conditions
   - When conditions are met (e.g., all documents verified), the transition is automatically executed
   - A new ApplicationStatus is created with the system user as the creator
   - Appropriate notifications are sent based on the new stage

### Condition Evaluation

Transition conditions are evaluated using the following process:

1. Each condition consists of a field, operator, and expected value
2. The system retrieves the actual value from the application data
3. The comparison is performed using the specified operator
4. Common operators include: equals, not equals, greater than, less than, contains, etc.
5. For a transition to be available, all conditions must be met

Example condition:
```json
{
  "field": "application_data.gpa",
  "operator": "gte",
  "value": 3.0
}
```

This condition would only allow the transition if the applicant's GPA is greater than or equal to 3.0.

## Workflow Templates

The system supports the creation and management of workflow templates to standardize admissions processes.

### Template Management

Administrators can:

- Create new workflow templates from scratch
- Duplicate existing workflows as templates
- Import and export workflow templates
- Activate a specific template for each application type

Only one workflow can be active for each application type at a time. When a new workflow is activated, the previously active workflow is automatically deactivated.

### Default Templates

The system includes several default workflow templates:

1. **Standard Undergraduate Admissions**:
   - Application Submission
   - Document Verification
   - Application Review
   - Committee Review (conditional)
   - Decision
   - Enrollment

2. **Graduate Admissions**:
   - Application Submission
   - Document Verification
   - Department Review
   - Faculty Interview (conditional)
   - Committee Review
   - Decision
   - Enrollment

3. **Transfer Admissions**:
   - Application Submission
   - Document Verification
   - Credit Evaluation
   - Application Review
   - Decision
   - Enrollment

These templates are provided as starting points and can be customized by each institution.

## Integration Points

The workflow system integrates with other components of the platform to provide a comprehensive admissions solution.

### Document Management

Integration with the document management system:

- Workflow stages can specify required documents
- Document uploads and verifications can trigger workflow transitions
- AI document analysis results can be used in transition conditions
- Document verification status is tracked as part of stage requirements

### Notification System

Integration with the notification system:

- Workflow stages define notification triggers
- Status changes generate notifications to applicants and staff
- Notifications can be sent via multiple channels (in-app, email, SMS)
- Templates can be customized for each notification type

### External Systems

Integration with external systems:

- Student Information System (SIS): Application data and decisions can be synchronized
- Learning Management System (LMS): Enrollment information can be passed to the LMS
- Payment Processing: Application fees and enrollment deposits can be linked to workflow stages
- External Document Verification: Third-party verification services can be integrated into the workflow

## Security Considerations

The workflow system implements several security measures to protect the integrity of the admissions process.

### Permission Model

The workflow system uses a role-based permission model:

- Each workflow stage can be assigned to specific roles
- Transitions can require specific permissions to execute
- Administrative actions (creating/editing workflows) require elevated permissions
- All actions are logged for audit purposes

### Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging is implemented for all workflow actions:

- Workflow creation and modification
- Stage and transition changes
- Application status changes
- Manual transition executions
- Automatic transition executions

Logs include the user who performed the action, timestamp, and relevant data.

### Data Validation

The system implements thorough validation:

- Workflow configurations are validated for completeness and correctness
- Transition conditions are validated before execution
- User permissions are checked for all manual actions
- Input data is sanitized and validated

## Performance Considerations

The workflow system is designed for optimal performance even with large volumes of applications.

### Caching Strategy

Redis caching is used for frequently accessed workflow data:

- Active workflows and their configurations
- Application status information
- Available transitions for applications
- Workflow validation results

Cache invalidation occurs when workflows are modified or application statuses change.

### Asynchronous Processing

Certain workflow operations are processed asynchronously:

- Automatic transition checking
- Notification sending
- Integration with external systems
- Bulk status updates

These operations use Laravel's queue system with Redis as the queue driver.

### Database Optimization

The database schema is optimized for workflow operations:

- Appropriate indexes on workflow_id, stage_id, and application_id fields
- Efficient queries for status history and transitions
- JSON columns for flexible storage of conditions and requirements
- Partitioning of application_statuses table for large installations

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the workflow system include:

### Advanced Features

- Parallel workflow paths for concurrent processing
- Time-based automatic transitions
- Advanced condition builder with more operators and functions
- Workflow analytics and optimization recommendations
- Machine learning integration for decision support
- Mobile workflow editor for on-the-go administration
