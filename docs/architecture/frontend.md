```

This structure separates concerns and organizes code by feature, making it easier to locate and maintain related code.

### 2.2 Code Organization Principles

The frontend codebase follows these key organizational principles:

1. **Feature-based Organization**: Components are grouped by feature or domain rather than by type, making it easier to locate related code.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data management.

3. **Component Composition**: Complex UI is built by composing smaller, focused components.

4. **Reusability**: Common components and utilities are shared across features.

5. **Encapsulation**: Features are self-contained with minimal dependencies on other features.

6. **Consistent Patterns**: Consistent naming, file structure, and coding patterns throughout the codebase.

### 2.3 Build and Bundling

The application uses Create React App with custom configuration through CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override) for building and bundling. Key build features include:

- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based code splitting to reduce initial load time

- **Asset Optimization**: Optimization of images and other assets
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration for development, testing, and production
- **Bundle Analysis**: Visualization of bundle size and composition for optimization

## 3. Component Architecture

The frontend application follows a component-based architecture with a clear hierarchy and composition model.

### 3.1 Component Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    App[App] --> Router[Router]
    Router --> Layouts[Layouts]
    Layouts --> Pages[Pages]
    Pages --> FeatureComponents[Feature Components]
    FeatureComponents --> CommonComponents[Common Components]
    
    subgraph "Application Shell"
        Router
        Layouts
    end
    
    subgraph "Feature Modules"
        Pages
        FeatureComponents
    end
    
    subgraph "Shared Components"
        CommonComponents
    end
```

The component hierarchy follows these levels:

1. **App**: The root component that sets up providers and routing
2. **Layouts**: Page layout components that define the structure of different sections
3. **Pages**: Components that represent complete pages and compose feature components
4. **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components that implement business functionality
5. **Common Components**: Reusable UI components shared across features

### 3.2 Component Types

The application uses several types of components with different responsibilities:

1. **Container Components**: Manage state, data fetching, and business logic
2. **Presentational Components**: Focus on rendering UI based on props

### 4.1 Redux Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Redux Store"
        Auth[Auth State]-->Store[Store]
        Applications[Applications State]-->Store
        Documents[Documents State]-->Store
        UI[UI State]-->Store
        Workflows[Workflows State]-->Store
        Messages[Messages State]-->Store
        Payments[Payments State]-->Store
        FinancialAid[Financial Aid State]-->Store
    end
    
    subgraph "Components"
        C1[Component 1]-->Selectors
        C2[Component 2]-->Selectors
        C3[Component 3]-->Selectors
    end
    
    Selectors-->Store
    Components-->Actions
    Actions-->Store
    
    subgraph "Middleware"
        Thunks[Thunk Middleware]
        Logger[Logger Middleware]
        Persist[Persist Middleware]
    end
    
    Actions-->Thunks
    Thunks-->API[API Calls]
    API-->Thunks
    Thunks-->Store
    Store-->Logger
    Store-->Persist
```

The Redux architecture follows these principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All application state is stored in a single Redux store
2. **State is Read-Only**: State can only be changed by dispatching actions
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that specify state changes
4. **Slices for Feature State**: State is organized into feature-specific slices
5. **Thunks for Async Logic**: Asynchronous operations are handled with Redux Thunks
6. **Selectors for Data Access**: Components access state through selector functions

### 4.2 Redux Store Structure

The Redux store is organized into feature-specific slices:

1. **auth**: Authentication state (user data, tokens, login status)
2. **applications**: Application management state (forms, statuses, tracking)
3. **documents**: Document management state (uploads, verification, status)
4. **ui**: UI state (theme, sidebar, modals, notifications)
5. **workflows**: Workflow state (stages, transitions, editor state)
6. **messages**: Messaging state (conversations, notifications, unread counts)
7. **payments**: Payment processing state (transactions, history, methods)
8. **financialAid**: Financial aid state (applications, documents, status)

Each slice is implemented using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` function, which generates actions and reducers with minimal boilerplate.

### 4.3 Redux Middleware

The Redux store is configured with several middleware components:

1. **Redux Thunk**: Enables asynchronous action creators for API calls and other side effects
2. **Redux Logger**: Provides detailed logging of actions and state changes (development only)
3. **Redux Persist**: Persists and rehydrates selected parts of the state across page reloads
4. **Serializable State Checker**: Ensures state is serializable for proper functioning

Middleware configuration is centralized in the store.ts file, with environment-specific settings for development and production.

### 4.4 State Persistence

Redux Persist is used to maintain state across browser sessions. The persistence configuration includes:

1. **Persisted Slices**: auth, ui (maintain authentication and user preferences)
2. **Storage Engine**: localStorage for persistent storage
3. **Rehydration**: Automatic state rehydration on application startup
4. **Serialization**: JSON serialization with special handling for non-serializable data

This approach ensures that users remain authenticated across page reloads and their preferences are maintained.

### 4.5 Local Component State

While Redux is used for global application state, local component state is managed using React's built-in state management:

1. **useState**: For simple state management within components
2. **useReducer**: For more complex local state with reducer-like logic
3. **useContext**: For sharing state within a component tree

The decision between local state and Redux state is based on the scope and sharing requirements of the data.

### 4.6 Server State Management

React Query is used for managing server state, providing:

1. **Data Fetching**: Declarative API for fetching data from the backend
2. **Caching**: Automatic caching of query results with configurable invalidation
3. **Background Updates**: Automatic refetching of data in the background
4. **Loading and Error States**: Built-in handling of loading and error states
5. **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**: Support for paginated and infinite data
6. **Mutations**: Simplified API for data mutations with optimistic updates

This approach separates server state from client state, providing a more efficient and maintainable solution for data fetching and synchronization.

## 5. API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API through a centralized API client that handles requests, authentication, and error management.

### 5.1 API Client Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    Components[Components] --> APIFunctions[API Functions]
    APIFunctions --> APIClient[API Client]
    APIClient --> RequestInterceptors[Request Interceptors]
    RequestInterceptors --> AxiosInstance[Axios Instance]
    AxiosInstance --> ResponseInterceptors[Response Interceptors]
    ResponseInterceptors --> ErrorHandling[Error Handling]
    
    subgraph "Authentication"
        RequestInterceptors --> AuthHeaders[Auth Headers]
        ResponseInterceptors --> TokenRefresh[Token Refresh]
    end
    
    subgraph "Error Processing"
        ErrorHandling --> NetworkErrors[Network Errors]
        ErrorHandling --> APIErrors[API Errors]
        ErrorHandling --> ValidationErrors[Validation Errors]
    end
    
    AxiosInstance --> BackendAPI[Backend API]
```
