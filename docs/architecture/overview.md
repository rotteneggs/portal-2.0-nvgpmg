- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Future Flexibility**: The modular design allows for potential migration to microservices if needed

### 2.2 Design Principles
The architecture is guided by the following design principles:

- **API-First Approach**: All interactions between frontend and backend components occur through RESTful APIs
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data access
- **Domain-Driven Design**: System organization around business domains and capabilities
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Critical system events trigger notifications and workflow transitions
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated throughout the architecture
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling of high-demand components
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and diagnostics

### 2.3 Technology Stack
The platform is built using a modern technology stack:

- **Backend**: Laravel 10.x (PHP 8.2+) for robust API development and business logic
- **Frontend**: React 18.x with TypeScript for a responsive single-page application
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ for relational data storage with strong ACID compliance
- **Caching**: Redis 7.0+ for high-performance caching and session management
- **Document Storage**: Amazon S3 for scalable document storage
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes or AWS ECS
