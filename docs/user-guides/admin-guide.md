## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Review Issues

- **Cannot update application status**: Verify you have the necessary permissions and that the application is in a state that allows the transition
- **Missing documents**: Check if the documents were uploaded but not yet processed, or if they were rejected during verification
- **Workflow errors**: Ensure the current workflow is properly configured with all necessary stages and transitions

#### Document Verification Issues

- **Document preview not loading**: Try refreshing the page or downloading the document to view it locally
- **AI analysis not available**: Check if the document was recently uploaded and may still be in the analysis queue
- **Verification decision not saving**: Ensure you've selected a decision and provided required comments

#### User Management Issues

- **Cannot create new user**: Verify you have administrator privileges and that the email address is not already in use
- **Role changes not taking effect**: Remember that role changes may require the user to log out and log back in
- **User cannot access certain features**: Check their role assignments and specific permissions

#### Reporting Issues

- **Reports not generating**: Check for filtering criteria that might be too restrictive
- **Export failing**: Try a different format or reducing the date range to create a smaller file
- **Charts not displaying**: Ensure your browser is updated and try clearing your cache
