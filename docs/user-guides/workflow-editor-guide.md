# Workflow Editor Guide

## Introduction

### Overview
The Workflow Editor is a powerful WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tool that allows administrators to visually create, edit, and manage admissions workflows in the Student Admissions Enrollment Platform. This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to use the workflow editor effectively.

### Purpose
Workflows define the journey of an application through the admissions process, from initial submission to final decision and enrollment. The workflow editor enables you to customize this journey according to your institution's specific requirements without requiring technical expertise.

## Accessing the Editor

### Navigation
To access the Workflow Editor, navigate to the Admin section of the platform and select 'Workflows' from the menu. From the workflows list, you can either create a new workflow or edit an existing one.

### Permissions
Note that you must have administrator privileges with the appropriate permissions to access and use the Workflow Editor.

## Editor Interface

### Layout
The Workflow Editor interface consists of several key components:

### Components
- **Editor Header**: Contains the workflow title, save button, test button, and back navigation.
- **Toolbar**: Provides action buttons for adding stages, creating connections, zooming, saving, testing, and deleting elements.
- **Canvas**: The main editing area where you visually design your workflow by adding stages and creating transitions between them.
- **Properties Panel**: A side panel that appears when you select a stage or transition, allowing you to edit its properties.
- **Minimap**: A small overview of the entire workflow that helps with navigation, especially for complex workflows.

## Creating Workflows

### New Workflow
#### Steps
1. From the Workflows list, click the 'Create New Workflow' button.
2. Enter a name and description for your workflow.
3. Select the application type (Undergraduate, Graduate, or Transfer) that this workflow will apply to.
4. Click 'Create' to open the workflow editor with a blank canvas.

### Workflow Settings
#### Description
Before designing your workflow, consider configuring these important settings:
#### Settings
- **Workflow Name**: A descriptive name that identifies the purpose of the workflow.
- **Description**: Detailed information about the workflow's purpose and usage.
- **Application Type**: The type of applications this workflow will process (Undergraduate, Graduate, or Transfer).
- **Active Status**: Whether the workflow is currently active and processing applications.

## Designing Workflows

### Adding Stages
#### Description
Stages represent distinct phases in the application process. Each application will progress through these stages during the admissions process.
#### Steps
1. Click the 'Add Stage' button in the toolbar.
2. Click on the canvas where you want to place the new stage.
3. A new stage will appear with a default name.
4. Click on the stage to select it and edit its properties in the side panel.

### Stage Properties
#### Description
When a stage is selected, the Properties panel allows you to configure various settings:
#### Properties
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the stage (e.g., 'Document Verification', 'Review', 'Decision').
- **Description**: Detailed information about the purpose of this stage.
- **Required Documents**: Documents that must be submitted and verified before an application can progress from this stage.
  - Options: Transcript, Personal Statement, Recommendation Letters, Test Scores, ID Verification, Financial Documents
- **Assigned Role**: The staff role responsible for processing applications in this stage.
- **Notifications**: Automatic notifications triggered during this stage.
  - Options: Notify student when stage begins, Notify student when documents verified, Notify student when stage completes, Notify admin team when assigned

### Creating Transitions
#### Description
Transitions define how applications move from one stage to another. They can be automatic or manual, and can have conditions that must be met.
#### Steps
1. Click the 'Create Connection' button in the toolbar.
2. Click on the source stage (where the transition starts).
3. Click on the target stage (where the transition ends).
4. A new transition arrow will appear connecting the two stages.
5. Click on the transition arrow to select it and edit its properties in the side panel.

### Transition Properties
#### Description
When a transition is selected, the Properties panel allows you to configure various settings:
#### Properties
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the transition (e.g., 'Documents Verified', 'Application Approved').
- **Description**: Detailed information about when this transition should occur.
- **Automatic Transition**: If enabled, the system will automatically execute this transition when all conditions are met, without requiring manual action.
- **Conditions**: Rules that must be satisfied for the transition to be available.
  - Condition Fields: Document Status, Application Data, Days in Stage, User Role
  - Condition Operators: Equals, Not Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, Contains, Not Contains
- **Required Permissions**: User permissions needed to manually execute this transition.

### Organizing the Canvas
#### Description
For complex workflows, organizing the canvas is important for clarity:
#### Tips
- Drag stages to reposition them on the canvas.
- Use the zoom controls to zoom in or out for better visibility.
- Use the minimap to navigate to different areas of large workflows.
- Arrange stages in a logical flow, typically from left to right or top to bottom.
- Group related stages visually by positioning them near each other.

## Validating Workflows

### Description
Before activating a workflow, it's important to validate it to ensure it will function correctly:
#### Validation Process
1. Click the 'Save' button to save your current workflow design.
2. Click the 'Test' button to validate the workflow.
3. The system will check for common issues such as:
   - Stages without any incoming or outgoing transitions
   - Circular references that could cause infinite loops
   - Missing required properties
   - Potential deadlocks where applications could get stuck
4. Review any validation errors or warnings that appear.
5. Make necessary corrections to address the issues.
6. Re-test until the workflow passes validation.

## Activating Workflows

### Description
Once your workflow is designed and validated, you can activate it to begin processing applications:
#### Activation Steps
1. Ensure the workflow has been saved and passes validation.
2. Click the 'Activate' button in the workflow settings.
3. Confirm the activation in the confirmation dialog.
4. Note that only one workflow per application type can be active at a time.
5. If another workflow of the same type is already active, you'll be prompted to deactivate it first.

### Deactivation
To deactivate a workflow, click the 'Deactivate' button in the workflow settings. Note that deactivating a workflow will not affect applications that are already being processed by it, but new applications will not use this workflow.

## Workflow Templates

### Description
The platform provides workflow templates to help you get started quickly:
#### Using Templates
1. From the Workflows list, click 'Create from Template'.
2. Select a template that matches your needs.
3. The template will be loaded into the editor where you can customize it.
4. Make any necessary adjustments to fit your specific requirements.
5. Save and activate the workflow when ready.

### Saving as Template
1. Design your workflow as usual.
2. Click 'Save as Template' in the workflow settings.
3. Enter a name and description for the template.
4. The template will be available for future use.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
- **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic workflow and add complexity gradually as you become more familiar with the editor.
- **Use Clear Naming**: Give stages and transitions descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.
- **Consider the Applicant Experience**: Design workflows that provide clear guidance and timely updates to applicants.
- **Plan for Exceptions**: Include paths for handling special cases or exceptions in the application process.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate and test workflows with sample applications before activating them for real applicants.
- **Document Your Design**: Use descriptions fields to document the purpose and behavior of stages and transitions.

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Patterns
- **Linear Flow**: A simple sequence of stages where each application moves through in order.
  - Example: Submission → Document Verification → Review → Decision → Enrollment
- **Conditional Branching**: Different paths based on application characteristics or decisions.
  - Example: Review → [If Approved] → Acceptance → Enrollment, or [If Rejected] → Rejection
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple stages that can occur simultaneously.
  - Example: Submission → [Document Verification and Financial Aid Review in parallel] → Decision
- **Loopback**: Returning to a previous stage if additional information is needed.
  - Example: Review → [If incomplete] → Request Additional Information → Submission → Review
- **Staged Approval**: Multiple approval stages with different roles.
  - Example: Initial Review → Department Approval → Financial Aid Review → Final Approval

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Cannot save workflow**: Ensure all required fields are completed and that you have the necessary permissions.
- **Transition not working as expected**: Check the transition conditions and ensure they are correctly configured.
- **Stage appears disconnected**: Ensure the stage has at least one incoming or outgoing transition.
- **Automatic transitions not triggering**: Verify that the 'Automatic Transition' option is enabled and all conditions are being met.
- **Validation errors persist**: Carefully review each error message and address them one by one.
- **Cannot activate workflow**: Ensure the workflow passes validation and that no other workflow of the same type is active.

## Advanced Topics

### Complex Conditions
#### Description
For sophisticated workflows, you can create complex conditions using multiple criteria:
#### Examples
- Document Status = 'Verified' AND Days in Stage > 3
- Application Data.GPA >= 3.5 OR Application Data.TestScore >= 1200
- User Role = 'Admissions Officer' AND Application Data.ProgramType = 'Honors'

### Integration with External Systems
#### Description
Workflows can integrate with external systems through the platform's integration services:
#### Examples
- Triggering data synchronization with Student Information Systems (SIS)
- Provisioning accounts in Learning Management Systems (LMS)
- Initiating background checks or credential verification services

### Workflow Analytics
#### Description
The platform provides analytics to help optimize your workflows:
#### Metrics
- Average time spent in each stage
- Conversion rates between stages
- Bottlenecks and processing delays
- Staff workload distribution
- Outcome analysis by application characteristics
